Scripted terminal recording.

## Introduction

> [!NOTE]
> The name `castwright` is a portmanteau of `asciicast` and `playwright`.

Have you re-recorded the same session over and over again, either to hit the right speed or to avoid mistakes? Ever wanted to automate the process of recording terminal sessions, like shell scripts automate the process of running commands? Well, `castwright` is here to help.

## Features

- **Painless scripting**: `castwright` scripts are very intuitive and similar to an interactive shell, making it easy to understand, write, and maintain.

## Installation

TBD

## Usage

TBD

## Reference

See [`REFERENCE.md`](./REFERENCE.md) for a detailed reference of the `castwright` script format (`.cw`).

## TODO

- [x] Implement the `castwright` script parser.
- [x] Write to an asciicast file.
- [ ] Actual command execution and output capture.
- [ ] Terminal width and height detection.
